## I’d like a fertility assessment

### Take control of your fertility health

If you're thinking about starting a family—or just want to understand your fertility better—a fertility assessment is a simple and proactive first step.

At **Great North Fertility**, we offer expert-led fertility checks in a welcoming, supportive environment. Whether you’re planning for now or the future, we’ll help you make informed choices.

### What does a fertility assessment involve?

Our comprehensive assessments are tailored to your needs but typically include:

#### For women:

* **Medical history and lifestyle review**
* **Pelvic ultrasound scan** to assess ovaries, uterus and egg reserve (antral follicle count)
* **Hormone blood tests** to measure ovarian reserve (AMH), ovulation, and general reproductive health

#### For men:

* **Medical history and lifestyle review**
* **Semen analysis** to assess sperm count, movement, and shape
* **Hormone blood tests** (if needed) to check testosterone and other key markers

You’ll receive a clear explanation of your results and personalised advice on next steps—from natural conception to treatment options if needed.

### Who is it for?

* Individuals or couples trying to conceive
* Anyone curious about their fertility potential
* People planning to delay having children
* Those with a history of medical issues affecting fertility

You don’t need a GP referral, and there’s no obligation to move forward with treatment.

* Friendly, specialist-led care with no waiting lists
* Honest, evidence-based advice tailored to you
* Trusted collaboration with **Manchester Fertility** for any advanced treatment
