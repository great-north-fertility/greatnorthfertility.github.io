## Treatments designed for you

At **Great North Fertility**, we understand that every fertility journey is different. That’s why we take the time to get to know you, listen to your needs, and build a treatment plan that feels right for you. With compassionate care, expert guidance, and access to the latest treatments, we’re here to support you at every stage.

### IVF / ICSI

**In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF)** is one of the most effective treatments for infertility. It involves fertilising eggs with sperm in a laboratory, before transferring embryos back into the womb.

Sometimes we recommend **Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)**, where a single sperm is carefully injected into the egg. This approach is often helpful if sperm numbers are low or sperm quality is reduced.  

At Great North Fertility we will provide your initial treatment investigations, treatment planning, scans and other appointments that don't require a HFEA licence. The parts of your treatment that do require a HFEA licence, such as your egg collection and embryo transfer, will be conducted by the award-winning team at the state-of-the-art clinic in South Manchester.

### Egg freezing

If you’re not ready to start a family yet but want to protect your fertility for the future, **egg freezing** can be a good option. Eggs are collected, frozen, and stored until you decide to use them.  

Egg freezing may be worth considering if:  

* You plan to delay parenthood  
* You’re about to undergo medical treatment that could affect fertility  
* You’d like the reassurance of knowing you have options later  

We will guide you through the whole process, from your first consultation to secure long-term storage.

### Donor treatments

For some, the best route to parenthood involves the use of donor eggs, sperm, or embryos. We offer professional and sensitive support for individuals and couples who are exploring these paths.  

We only work with carefully screened donors, and every treatment is carried out in line with **HFEA (Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority)** regulations.  

Whether you’re a same-sex couple, a single parent, or facing medical or age-related challenges, donor treatment could help you build the family you’ve been hoping for.

### Genetic testing

Genetic testing can provide valuable insights into embryo health and increase the chance of a successful pregnancy.  

We offer a range of advanced testing options, including:  

* **Pre-implantation Genetic Testing (PGT)** – checks embryos for genetic conditions before transfer  
* **Screening for inherited conditions** – if there’s a known family history of genetic disease  
* **Recurrent miscarriage investigations** – to explore and address underlying causes  

Our expert team will help you decide whether testing is right for you and explain the results in clear, supportive language.

### Your journey, our support

Every treatment plan at Great North Fertility is built around your personal circumstances. We’ll be honest, open, and with you from your first appointment through to your final steps.
