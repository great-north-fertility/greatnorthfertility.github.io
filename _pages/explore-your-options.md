## Considering Freezing Eggs?

### Explore Your Options with Confidence

Whether you're planning for the future, focusing on your career, haven’t met the right partner yet, or facing medical treatment that could affect your fertility—freezing your eggs or sperm can give you more control over your reproductive choices.

At **Great North Fertility**, we offer personalised advice and expert care to help you make the decision that’s right for you.

### Why Consider Freezing?

**Egg Freezing**
Egg quality naturally declines with age. Freezing your eggs at a younger age can improve your chances of a successful pregnancy later in life.

### What to Expect

* **Expert Consultation** – We’ll guide you through the medical, emotional, and practical aspects of freezing eggs or sperm.
* **Fertility Testing** – We assess your current fertility and discuss your chances of success in the future.
* **Safe, Regulated Storage** – Your eggs are stored securely in partnership with our trusted IVF laboratory at **Manchester Fertility**.

### Is It Right for Me?

Fertility preservation isn’t for everyone, but if you're considering it, an early conversation can make a big difference. We are here to provide honest advice and support—no pressure, just clear options.

**Protect your future fertility. Start the conversation today.**
